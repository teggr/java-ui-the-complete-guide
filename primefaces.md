PrimeFaces is the premier UI component library for Jakarta EE's JavaServer Faces framework. It provides over 100 rich, modern components including data tables, charts, dialogs, file uploads, and more—all with responsive design built in. PrimeFaces emphasizes ease of use with minimal configuration and extensive documentation, making it straightforward to build professional enterprise web applications. Backed by PrimeTek, a commercial company that ensures consistent development and support, PrimeFaces has become the de facto standard for teams building JSF applications in the Jakarta EE ecosystem.

## Code Example

```java
// Backing bean
@Named
@ViewScoped
public class HelloBean implements Serializable {
    private String message = "Hello, PrimeFaces!";
    
    public String getMessage() { return message; }
    public void setMessage(String message) { this.message = message; }
}

// XHTML view:
// <p:outputLabel value="#{helloBean.message}" />
// <p:commandButton value="Update" update="@form" />
```
