JavaPackager is a hybrid plugin for both Maven and Gradle that provides a unified, simple way to package Java applications into native executables and installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Unlike jpackage or platform-specific tools that require different configurations for each platform, JavaPackager offers a consistent API across build systems and operating systems. It can generate Windows executables (EXE) and installers (MSI via WiX), macOS disk images (DMG) and packages (PKG), and Linux packages (DEB, RPM) and AppImages—all from a single configuration. The plugin automatically bundles a JRE with your application, handles native launcher generation, manages file associations, and supports elevation/administrator privileges when needed. Originally created as an educational tool to simplify teaching Java application distribution, it has evolved into a production-ready solution used by applications like AstroImageJ and Astro Pixel Processor. JavaPackager strikes an excellent balance between simplicity and functionality—it's easier to use than jpackage while still providing the essential features needed for professional desktop application deployment. For teams working with both Maven and Gradle, or those seeking a simpler alternative to jpackage with more automation, JavaPackager is an excellent choice.

## Code Example

```gradle
// build.gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.github.fvarrui:javapackager:1.7.7'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'io.github.fvarrui.javapackager.plugin'

task packageMyApp(type: io.github.fvarrui.javapackager.gradle.PackageTask, dependsOn: build) {
    // Mandatory
    mainClass = 'com.example.Main'
    
    // Optional
    bundleJre = true
    generateInstaller = true
    administratorRequired = false
    platform = "auto"  // or "linux", "mac", "windows"
    
    // Platform-specific configuration
    winConfig {
        icoFile = file('src/main/resources/icon.ico')
        generateSetup = true
        generateMsi = true
    }
    
    macConfig {
        icnsFile = file('src/main/resources/icon.icns')
        generateDmg = true
        generatePkg = true
    }
    
    linuxConfig {
        pngFile = file('src/main/resources/icon.png')
        generateDeb = true
        generateRpm = true
    }
}

// Build: gradle packageMyApp
```
