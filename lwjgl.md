LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) is a low-level Java library providing direct access to native APIs for graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA), and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR). Unlike higher-level game engines, LWJGL gives you bare-metal performance with minimal overhead between Java and native code through efficient memory management and zero-copy buffer operations. It's the foundation behind popular projects like Minecraft and is used by many Java game engines including LibGDX and jMonkeyEngine. LWJGL 3 features automatic native library extraction, improved API design with method chaining, and comprehensive bindings that are automatically generated from native headers. The library is open source (BSD license), actively maintained, and provides exceptional cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS. While LWJGL requires deep understanding of graphics APIs and manual resource management, it offers unmatched control and performance for developers building custom engines, renderers, or applications requiring direct GPU access. Perfect for experienced developers who need low-level access to graphics hardware without sacrificing Java's portability and ecosystem benefits.

## Code Example

```java
import org.lwjgl.glfw.*;
import org.lwjgl.opengl.*;
import static org.lwjgl.glfw.GLFW.*;
import static org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11.*;
import static org.lwjgl.system.MemoryUtil.*;

public class HelloLWJGL {
    private long window;

    public void run() {
        init();
        loop();
        
        glfwDestroyWindow(window);
        glfwTerminate();
    }

    private void init() {
        if (!glfwInit()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to initialize GLFW");
        }
        
        window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "Hello LWJGL", NULL, NULL);
        glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);
        GL.createCapabilities();
        glClearColor(0.0f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
    }

    private void loop() {
        while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
            glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
            glfwSwapBuffers(window);
            glfwPollEvents();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new HelloLWJGL().run();
    }
}
```
