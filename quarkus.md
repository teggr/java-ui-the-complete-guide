Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and OpenJDK HotSpot, designed for building modern cloud-native and serverless applications. Now part of the Commonhaus Foundation, it provides amazingly fast boot times and incredibly low memory footprint by performing optimization at build-time through a technique called "compile time boot." Quarkus offers live reload development with near-instant feedback, reactive and imperative programming models on the same reactive core, and deep integration with over 50 best-of-breed libraries including RESTEasy, Hibernate, Vert.x, and more. It excels at container-first deployments with sub-second startup times and minimal RSS memory usage, making it ideal for Kubernetes environments, microservices architectures, and serverless functions. The framework emphasizes developer joy through unified configuration, zero-config defaults, and streamlined code for common use cases while remaining flexible for advanced scenarios.

## Code Example

```java
import jakarta.ws.rs.*;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Quarkus!";
    }
    
    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}

// Run with: ./mvnw quarkus:dev
// Native build: ./mvnw package -Pnative
```
